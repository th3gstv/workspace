# 🐍 Python Learning Repository

This repository was created to document my journey learning the Python programming language. Here you'll find class notes, exercises, and small projects applying the concepts I'm currently studying.

## 📚 Purpose

To strengthen my understanding of Python through hands-on practice, including:

- Data structures  
- Object-oriented programming (OOP)  
- File handling  
- Popular libraries (e.g., `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `requests`)  
- Problem-solving and algorithm logic  
- Small project development
